# coq
==========

## Description ##

 Coq is an interactive theorem prover.
 
 These files are assignments and their solutions (my interpretation) for the course by Kevin Hamlin in UTD F13.


## How to use?? ##

Use either coqide or coq proof assistant to load these.
Alternatively if you are using linux use a compatible editor (emacs) with proper plugins to make it work.

## AVLTree ##

The AVL Tree proof is the final project for the course. The proof is not efficient (as discussed with Dr. Hamlen) but atleast we managed to prove the tree.
